🛡️ Cyber Risk Dashboard

📌 Overview

The Cyber Risk Dashboard is an interactive web-based tool designed to help users quantify and visualize cybersecurity risk using financial impact models. The dashboard allows users to adjust key parameters such as Asset Value, Exposure Factor, and Attack Frequency, and automatically calculates metrics like:

Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)

Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)

This project bridges classroom cybersecurity theory with real-world business decision-making, helping users understand how risk values translate into financial consequences. It's especially useful for cybersecurity students, GRC teams, analysts, and SOC professionals looking to practice risk-based analysis.

🚀 Features

✔️ Interactive sliders for real-time risk calculation
✔️ Automatic computation of SLE, ARO, and ALE
✔️ Clean and user-friendly interface
✔️ Instant visualization of impact based on changing values
✔️ Lightweight and browser-based (no server required)
