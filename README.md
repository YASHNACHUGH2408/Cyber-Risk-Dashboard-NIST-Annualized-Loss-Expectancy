# 🛡️ Cyber Risk Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

The **Cyber Risk Dashboard** is an interactive, browser-based tool designed to quantify and visualize cybersecurity risks using financial risk assessment models. It enables users to understand how technical cyber threats translate into **real-world business and financial impact**.

By adjusting key risk parameters such as **Asset Value**, **Exposure Factor**, and **Attack Frequency**, the dashboard automatically calculates:

* **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**
* **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**
* **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**

This project effectively bridges **classroom cybersecurity theory** with **practical, business-driven risk analysis**, making it highly valuable for students and professionals alike.



## 🎯 Purpose & Use Case

This dashboard is ideal for:

* 🎓 Cybersecurity students learning risk assessment
* 🏢 GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) teams
* 📊 Security analysts and risk analysts
* 🛡️ SOC professionals practicing risk-based decision-making

It helps users **visualize how changes in risk factors directly impact financial loss**, supporting informed security investments and controls.



## 🚀 Features

* ✔️ Interactive sliders for real-time risk calculation
* ✔️ Automatic computation of SLE, ARO, and ALE
* ✔️ Clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface
* ✔️ Instant visualization of financial impact
* ✔️ Lightweight and fully browser-based
* ✔️ No backend or server setup required
